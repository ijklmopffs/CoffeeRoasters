# CoffeeRoasters

This is a coffee subscription website. You can create a coffee plan tailored to you with various options available such as:

- How you take your coffee
- What type
- How much coffee you would like(measured in grams)
- Whether you want them ground or not
- How often should the coffee be delivered

The prices are listed for however often you want them delivered, and how many grams you want delivered with them.

Written in React and TailwindCss, the website has a lot of logic to it, helping power the various activities on the website. For example, when the "Capsule" option is selected, the option for whether it should be grinded or not is automatically deactivated. Also the order summary is constantly updated in real time depending on your selected options. Be sure to enjoy the website.
